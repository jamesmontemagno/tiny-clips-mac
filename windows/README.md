# Tiny Clips for Windows

A native **WinUI 3 / Windows App SDK** port of Tiny Clips — a tray-based screen-capture app
(screenshots, video, GIF). See the full design in
[`/plans/windows-winui3-port-plan.md`](../plans/windows-winui3-port-plan.md).

> Status: **Phases 1–3 substantially complete** — tray app with the region/screen/window
> capture picker, screenshot, MP4 video + animated GIF recording, post-capture screenshot editor
> and video/GIF trimmers, an on-screen recording indicator, global hotkeys, pre-capture countdown
> with a region outline, save toasts, launch-at-login, a full native Settings window, first-run
> onboarding, and a Guide. Pro-only features (mouse-click visuals, branding overlay, upload) are
> present but gated. Real-time overlay compositing and microphone/system-audio muxing are not yet
> implemented; packaging/Store work is deferred. See the plan for the full roadmap.

## Features

- **Capture picker** — choose **Region**, **Screen**, or **Window** (R / S / W) before any capture,
  mirroring the macOS picker, with an inline pre-capture countdown.
- **Screenshot** (PNG/JPEG, scale, quality) — full screen, a specific window, or a drag-selected **region**.
  The region selector shows a live snapshot of the screen and dims only outside the selection.
- **Video recording** → hardware-accelerated **H.264 MP4** (configurable frame rate, time limit).
- **GIF recording** → animated GIF (frame rate, max-width downscale, infinite loop).
- **Recording indicator** — a floating always-on-top panel shows the elapsed time and a Stop button
  (with the stop hotkey) while recording.
- **Editor & trimmers** — an optional post-capture **screenshot editor** (crop, copy, save / save-a-copy),
  a **video trimmer**, and a **GIF trimmer**, each openable automatically after capture.
- **Region outline** — a red outline frames the selected region during the countdown.
- **Onboarding & Guide** — a first-run welcome wizard and an in-app help reference.
- **Global hotkeys** — Screenshot `Ctrl+Shift+5`, Video `Ctrl+Shift+6`, GIF `Ctrl+Shift+7`,
  Stop recording `Ctrl+Shift+S`.
- **Launch at login** — optionally start TinyClips when you sign in to Windows.
- **Pre-capture countdown** and **save toast notifications** (both opt-in via Settings).
- **System-tray** Fluent menu (rounded/acrylic), light/dark/system theming, full **Settings** window.

## Requirements

- Windows 11 **22H2 (build 22621)** or later
- [.NET 10 SDK](https://dotnet.microsoft.com/)
- Windows SDK `10.0.26100`
- **Developer Mode** enabled (Settings → System → For developers) for MSIX sideload/registration
- Optional: [Windows App Development CLI (`winapp`)](https://learn.microsoft.com/windows/apps/dev-tools/winapp-cli/)
  for identity, manifest, signing, and MSIX packaging:
  ```powershell
  winget install Microsoft.winappcli --source winget
  ```

## Project layout

```

## Build & run

WinUI 3 requires an explicit platform (`x64` or `ARM64`; `AnyCPU` is not supported).

```powershell
# Restore
dotnet restore windows/TinyClips.Windows.slnx

# Build the app
dotnet build windows/src/TinyClips.App/TinyClips.App.csproj -c Debug -p:Platform=x64

# Run with package identity (uses the winapp CLI under the hood)
dotnet run --project windows/src/TinyClips.App/TinyClips.App.csproj -c Debug -p:Platform=x64

# Test
dotnet test windows/tests/TinyClips.Core.Tests/TinyClips.Core.Tests.csproj -c Debug
```

The app launches **tray-only** (no window). Left- or right-click the tray icon for the Fluent
menu: **Screenshot**, **Capture Region**, **Record Video**, **Record GIF**, **Settings**,
**Guide**, **Exit**. Capture items first show the **Region / Screen / Window** picker.
Recording items toggle to **Stop Recording** (also `Ctrl+Shift+S`) while active, and a floating
recording indicator shows the elapsed time. Global hotkeys work app-wide.

For coordinate/DPI behaviour across mixed-DPI monitors, see
[`docs/dpi-and-coordinates.md`](docs/dpi-and-coordinates.md).

## CI

`.github/workflows/windows-build.yml` builds `x64` + `ARM64` and runs the Core tests on
`windows-latest`. It is path-filtered to `windows/**`, so it only runs when Windows code changes.

## Distribution (planned)

- **Direct:** signed MSIX + `.appinstaller` auto-update, plus a winget manifest. Fully free.
- **Microsoft Store:** Store auto-update + Pro add-ons (Pro is Store-only).

See the plan for the full phased roadmap, packaging, and signing details.
