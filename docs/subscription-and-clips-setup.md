# Subscription Tiers & Clips Manager Setup Guide

This document covers what you need to do before shipping the subscription system and Clips Manager updates.

---

## 1. App Store Connect — Product IDs

Register three in-app purchase products in [App Store Connect](https://appstoreconnect.apple.com):

| Product ID | Type | Notes |
|---|---|---|
| `com.refractored.tinyclips.pro.monthly` | Auto-Renewable Subscription | Monthly billing |
| `com.refractored.tinyclips.pro.yearly` | Auto-Renewable Subscription | Yearly billing |
| `com.refractored.tinyclips.pro.lifetime` | Non-Consumable | One-time purchase |

### Steps

1. Go to **App Store Connect → Your App → Subscriptions**
2. Create a **Subscription Group** (for monthly/yearly) if needed
3. Add `monthly` and `yearly` to the subscription group
4. Add `lifetime` under **In-App Purchases** as non-consumable
5. Set pricing and localized metadata
6. Submit products for review

## 2. StoreKit Testing (Sandbox)

Before shipping, test all purchase flows:

1. Create sandbox tester accounts in App Store Connect
2. Optionally create a local `.storekit` configuration file in Xcode with the same product IDs
3. Verify:
   - [ ] Purchase monthly subscription
   - [ ] Purchase yearly subscription
   - [ ] Purchase lifetime unlock
   - [ ] Restore purchases (monthly/yearly/lifetime)
   - [ ] Subscription renewal/expiry behavior
   - [ ] Paywall pricing displays correctly
   - [ ] Manage subscription link works for active subscribers

---

## 3. Pro Gating Verification (App Store Build)

The Clips Manager uses read-only mode for free users:

- [ ] Free users can browse and preview clips
- [ ] Free users see upgrade banner/upsell prompts
- [ ] Rename/Tag/Notes/Favorites/Delete/Batch actions are gated
- [ ] Pro users have full organization features
- [ ] Direct distribution build has no Pro gating

---

## 4. UI Verification

- [ ] `ProSubscriptionView` fits in Settings window
- [ ] Smart collections and tags sidebar filtering works
- [ ] Auto-tags render with tertiary style (distinct from user tags)
- [ ] Sort & Filter menu + search + list/grid toggle behave correctly
- [ ] Grid/list layouts remain stable at narrow widths

---

## 5. Uploadcare (Bring Your Own Account)

TinyClips does not ship with Uploadcare credentials. Users configure their own Uploadcare account in Clips Manager Upload Settings.

### User setup

1. Create an Uploadcare account: <https://uploadcare.com/>
2. Open **Uploadcare Dashboard → Project → API Keys**
3. Copy your project **Public API Key** and **Secret API Key**
4. In TinyClips **Clips Manager → gear (Upload Settings)**:
   - Enable **Uploadcare uploads**
   - Paste your **Uploadcare public API key**
   - Paste your **Uploadcare secret API key** (password field with Show/Hide)
   - TinyClips stores both keys in your macOS Keychain

### Behavior

- Upload action appears in Clips Manager list/grid/context menu.
- TinyClips uploads directly to Uploadcare Upload API (`/base/`) using signed upload fields (`signature` + `expire`).
- TinyClips resolves the saved link from Uploadcare REST API `GET /files/{uuid}/` (`original_file_url` fallback `url`).
- Returned Uploadcare URL is copied to clipboard after a successful upload.
- If keys are missing/invalid, TinyClips shows an upload error and no upload is performed.

### Verification checklist

- [ ] Uploadcare toggle + public/secret key fields are visible and save correctly
- [ ] Upload a screenshot clip to Uploadcare succeeds
- [ ] Upload a video/GIF clip under 100 MiB succeeds
- [ ] Returned Uploadcare URL is copied to clipboard
- [ ] Missing/invalid key path shows clear error
